# Prompts History

This file contains all the prompts/queries provided during the development of this GitHub Actions Scroll Helper extension.

---

1. **Github has a layout for actions where each pane is collapsible where you can click and it shows log for that step. I want you to create a chrome extension that adds a button with scroll to bottom unicode emoji icon in each pane so when I click it, it takes me to 99% of the way to the bottom which is where we usually need to see the errors**

2. **What unicode emoji icon do you suggest for this button?**

3. **perfect. Go ahead. Use browser to use this as testbed <url>**

4. **try again in same window**

5. **ok leave it. we cannot use browser somehow. Lets test extension after you have first version out. So go ahead and give it a shot**

6. **it does not work. <url> this is open source and might open withlout login can you check.**

7. **5 different attempts to test the browser**

8. **i told you to navigate to original page that we want why the fuck did you click back?**

9. **try now**

10. **open some other pane like setup paradedb to latest**

11. **Okay, so you understand the bug, right? If I click on the button, this new button, it does not take me to the bottom of the logs of that pane. It is not doing what it is supposed to do.**

12. **try playing around with it now. it does scroll down but does it scroll to the bottom?**

13. **make it 99 percent please?**

14. **We should not show this icon if the pane is closed. We should show it only if the pane is open. And there is room to scroll if there is like five lines of log that everything is visible in the screen itself that we don't have to. Then we also don't need to show this. Add a readme to it, that should have like how to use, but also how this works, what are its major, just a summary of the way you've written it. We don't have to be too detailed in the readme, just to be very brief.**

15. **When the pane is... So I think assess the behavior on your browser. I'm going to open this page again and assess it. I think it's opening to... it's not waiting for the logs to appear. As soon as I click, it shows up irrespective of the size. It should wait for the logs to fill in and maybe show up only if the logs are more than, let's say, 50 lines. The extension is reloaded right now.**

16. **review the readme content.. seems duplicate as well as does it capture all description?**
